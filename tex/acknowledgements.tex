First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach, for his guidance, contagious enthusiasm and all the long hours he has dedicated towards our discussions.

Lastly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my parents, Iulic\u{a} and Melania, and my girlfriend, Daria, for their unconditional love and support throughout the years.
